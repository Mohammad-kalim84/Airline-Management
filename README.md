## ▶️ How to Run the Project

1. Make sure Python 3 is installed on your system.

2. Install the required dependency:
   pip install colorama

3. Ensure both files are located in the same directory:
   - Airline_Management.py
   - Airline_details.txt

4. Run the program using the following command:
   python Airline_Management.py


📄 Input File
The file Airline_details.txt contains airline-related information required by the program.
If the file is missing or not found, the program will display an appropriate error message and terminate safely.
