# ✈️ Airline Management System (Python)

A console-based Airline Management System developed in Python.  
This project simulates airline routes between countries, manages airline data, and processes travel information using matrices and structured data.

---

## 📌 Features

- Manage multiple airlines and countries
- Represent airline routes using adjacency matrices
- Read airline data from external text files
- Handle file errors gracefully (FileNotFoundError)
- Store and process passenger and airline satisfaction data
- Clear, structured, and modular Python code

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Standard Python libraries
- colorama (for colored console output)

---

## 📂 Project Structure

Airline-Management/
│
├── Airline_Management.py    # Main Python program
├── Airline_details.txt      # External data file

---

## ▶️ How to Run the Project

1. Make sure Python 3 is installed on your system.
2. Install required dependency:
   `bash
   pip install colorama
3. Ensure both files are in the same directory:
     - Airline_Management.py
     - Airline_details.txt
4. Run the program:
     - python Airline_Management.py
  


📄 Input File
The file Airline_details.txt is used to store airline-related data.
The program checks for the file’s existence and displays an error message if it is missing.

🧠 Core Concepts Demonstrated
. Dictionaries, lists, and sets in Python
. Matrix representation of relationships
. File handling and exception handling
. Data organization and validation
. Clean code structure and readability

🎯 Use Cases
. Academic Python projects
. Learning data structures (matrices & dictionaries)
. Console-based management systems
. Algorithm and logic practice

🚀 Future Improvements
. Add a user-friendly menu system
. Convert the project into an object-oriented design (OOP)
. Add data visualization
. Store data in a database instead of text files
. Add unit tests
