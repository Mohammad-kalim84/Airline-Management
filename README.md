# ✈️ Airline Management System (Python)

A console-based **Airline Management System** developed in Python.  
This project simulates airline routes between different countries and manages airline-related data using structured data and matrix representations.

---

## 📌 Features

- Manage multiple airlines and countries
- Represent airline routes using **adjacency matrices**
- Read airline data from an external text file
- Handle file-related errors gracefully (e.g. missing files)
- Store and process airline and passenger satisfaction data
- Clear and structured Python code

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- Standard Python libraries
- `colorama` (for colored console output)

---

## ▶️ How to Run the Project

1. Make sure **Python 3** is installed on your system.
2. Install the required dependency:

```bash
pip install colorama
```
3. Ensure both files are in the same directory:
   - Airline_Management.py
   - Airline_details.txt

4. Run the program:
```bash
python Airline_Management.py
```

---

📄 Input File
The file Airline_details.txt contains airline-related information required by the program.
If the file is missing or not found, the program will display an appropriate error message and terminate safely.
